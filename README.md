# My Personal Project

## Phase 0

***What will the application do?***

The application will be a book tracking application that allows the user to track 
the books they’ve read recently, including their five-star rating of the book, 
any reviews they’ve left, and the genre. Using the application, users can 
rank their favourite books and authors, make lists of books they want to read, 
and set goals for how many books they’d like to read while comparing it to their 
current progress.

***Who will use it?***

Bookworms interested in keeping their book ratings/reviews in one place and 
tracking how many books they’ve read. The application would also work 
well for users looking to get more into reading, who want to set goals and 
track their progress.

***Why is this project of interest to you?***

I love to read, and I’ve always enjoyed being able to review the books I’ve 
read and share my thoughts with my friends. In the past, I’ve used an app called 
GoodReads to rate books, but I’ve found the app to be outdated and lacking in different 
functionalities. This project will be a fun opportunity to create the features and 
design choices that I would like to see in a book-tracking application as a reader 
myself and someone who would actually use an application like this.
